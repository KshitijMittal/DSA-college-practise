| 1 | **Reverse an Array**<br>You are given an array of integers `arr[]`. You have to reverse the given array.<br>**Note:** Modify the array in place.<br><br>**Examples:**<br>Input: $arr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]$<br>Output: `[5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1]`<br>Explanation: The elements of the array are `[1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]`. After reversing the array, the first element goes to the last position, the second element goes to the second last position and so on. Hence, the answer is `[5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.<br><br>[Link: GeeksforGeeks - Reverse an Array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reverse-an-array/1) | In Class |
| 1 | **Find Minimum and Maximum Elements**<br>Given an array `arr[]`. Your task is to find the minimum and maximum elements in the array.<br><br>**Examples:**<br>Input: $arr[] = [1, 4, 3, 5, 8, 6]$<br>Output: `[1, 8]`<br>Explanation: minimum and maximum elements of array are 1 and 8.<br><br>[Link: GeeksforGeeks - Find Min and Max](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-minimum-and-maximum-element-in-an-array4428/1) | In Class |
| 1 | **Kth Smallest Element**<br>Given an integer array `arr[]` and an integer `k`, your task is to find and return the $k^{th}$ smallest element in the given array.<br>**Note:** The kth smallest element is determined based on the sorted order of the array.<br><br>**Examples:**<br>Input: $arr[] = [10, 5, 4, 3, 48, 6, 2, 33, 53, 10]$, $k=4$<br>Output: 5<br>Explanation: 4th smallest element in the given array is 5.<br><br>[Link: GeeksforGeeks - Kth Smallest Element](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/kth-smallest-element/0) | Take Home |
| 1 | **Union of Two Arrays**<br>You are given two arrays `a[]` and `b[]`, return the Union of both the arrays in any order.<br>The Union of two arrays is a collection of all distinct elements present in either of the arrays. If an element appears more than once in one or both arrays, it should be included only once in the result.<br>**Note:** Elements of `a[]` and `b[]` are not necessarily distinct.<br>**Note that:** You can return the Union in any order but the driver code will print the result in sorted order only.<br><br>**Examples:**<br>Input: $a[] = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]$, $b[] = [3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2]$<br>Output: `[1, 2, 3]`<br>Explanation: Union set of both the arrays will be 1, 2 and 3.<br><br>[Link: GeeksforGeeks - Union of Two Arrays](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/union-of-two-arrays3538/1) | Take Home |
| 1 | **Largest Element in Array**<br>Given an array `arr[]`. The task is to find the largest element and return it.<br><br>**Examples:**<br>Input: $arr[] = [1, 8, 7, 56, 90]$<br>Output: 90<br>Explanation: The largest element of the given array is 90.<br><br>[Link: GeeksforGeeks - Largest Element](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/largest-element-in-array4009/0?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=collab_striver_ytdescription&utm_campaign=largest-element-in-array) | Take Home |
| 2 | **Cyclically Rotate an Array**<br>Given an array `arr`, rotate the array by one position in clockwise direction.<br><br>**Examples:**<br>Input: $arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$<br>Output: `[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]`<br>Explanation: If we rotate arr by one position in clockwise 5 come to the front and remaining those are shifted to the end.<br><br>[Link: GeeksforGeeks - Cyclically Rotate](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/cyclically-rotate-an-array-by-one2614/1) | In Class |
| 2 | **Kadane's Algorithm (Max Subarray Sum)**<br>You are given an integer array `arr[]`. You need to find the maximum sum of a subarray (containing at least one element) in the array `arr[]`.<br>**Note:** A subarray is a continuous part of an array.<br><br>**Examples:**<br>Input: $arr[] = [2, 3, -8, 7, -1, 2, 3]$<br>Output: 11<br>Explanation: The subarray `[7, -1, 2, 3]` has the largest sum 11.<br><br>[Link: GeeksforGeeks - Kadane's Algorithm](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/kadanes-algorithm/0) | In Class |
| 2 | **Search Insert Position**<br>Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.<br>You must write an algorithm with $O(log~n)$ runtime complexity.<br><br>**Example 1:**<br>Input: nums $= [1, 3, 5, 6]$, $target = 5$<br>Output: 2<br><br>[Link: LeetCode - Search Insert Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=array) | Take Home |
| 2 | **Two Sum**<br>Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.<br>You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.<br>You can return the answer in any order.<br><br>**Example 1:**<br>Input: nums $= [2, 7, 11, 15]$, $target = 9$<br>Output: `[0, 1]`<br>Explanation: Because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.<br><br>[Link: LeetCode - Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=array) | Take Home |
| 2 | **Minimum Number of Jumps**<br>You are given an array `arr[]` of non-negative numbers. Each number tells you the maximum number of steps you can jump forward from that position.<br>For example: If $arr[i] = 3$ you can jump to index $i+1$, $i+2$, or $i+3$ from position $i$.<br>If $arr[i] = 0$, you cannot jump forward from that position.<br>Your task is to find the minimum number of jumps needed to move from the first position in the array to the last position.<br>**Note:** Return -1 if you can't reach the end of the array.<br><br>**Examples:**<br>Input: arr $= [1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9]$<br>Output: 3<br>Explanation: First jump from 1st element to 2nd element with value 3. From here we jump to 5th element with value 9, and from here we will jump to the last.<br><br>[Link: GeeksforGeeks - Minimum Jumps](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-number-of-jumps-1587115620/1) | Take Home |
